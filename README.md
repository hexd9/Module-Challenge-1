# <Horiseon Marketing Agency>

## Description

The refractoring of this project was essential for my client (Horiseon Marketing Agency) as their current webpage lacked various accessibility features. I built this project to ensure that the webpage meet all accessibility standards and in the process cleaned up the current HTML file. The HTML file has now been updated with proper semantic structure which will improve the following: accessibility for users with disabilities, ease of refractoring in the future or maintenance to the code, and search engine optimization. During the project I had the opportunity to learn how to break down an HTML file and update the file with semantic structure. Additionally, I found that organizing the css style sheet to follow the HTML's semantic structure will make it easier to maintain the webpage when updates are needed.
